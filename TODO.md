    *   **Optimization:** Ensure images are optimized for web (e.g., compressed, converted to WebP format) to maintain fast loading times.
    *   **Status:** **PENDING (Requires Manual Action)**

2.  **Update SEO Metadata Placeholders:**

    *   **Status:** **DONE**

3.  **Add Live Demo Links (if applicable):

    *   **Status:** **PENDING (Requires Manual Action)**

2.  **Advanced Interactive Elements:**
    *   **Consideration:** If desired, explore adding more complex interactive elements like 3D animations (e.g., using Three.js/React Three Fiber), terminal-style interfaces, or custom cursor effects, as seen in some top-tier portfolios.
    *   **Status:** **CONSIDERATION (Requires specific instructions to implement)**

3.  **Blog/Articles Section:**
    *   **Consideration:** Adding a blog or articles section can demonstrate thought leadership and provide more context on your projects or technical insights.
