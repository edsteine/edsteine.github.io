## âœ¨ Enhancements & Best Practices (Requires Your Input/Design Decisions):

1.  **Improve Mobile Responsiveness (Collapsible Sections):**
    *   **Consideration:** For very long text sections (e.g., "About Me", "Languages"), consider implementing collapsible sections on mobile to reduce density and improve readability. This would require significant UI/UX changes.

2.  **Add Visual Hierarchy (Further Improvements):**
    *   **Consideration:** Explore using color coding for different sections to enhance visual appeal and distinction.
    *   **Consideration:** Add icons for technologies in your skills and project sections. This would involve sourcing appropriate icons and modifying `src/components/ProjectCard.tsx` and `src/components/Skills.tsx`.
    *   **Consideration:** Implement more distinct card-like structures or containers for other sections (e.g., "About Me", "Languages", "Education") to break up text blocks and improve visual organization.

3.  **Performance (Image Optimization):**
    *   **Action:** Once you replace the placeholder images, ensure they are properly optimized for web (compressed, appropriate formats). While `next/image` handles lazy loading, the initial image size still impacts performance.

4.  **Accessibility (Further Review):**
    *   **Action:** Conduct a thorough review of keyboard navigation to ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
    *   **Action:** Review and explicitly add focus states (e.g., using Tailwind's `focus:` variants) to all interactive elements to provide clear visual feedback for keyboard users.
    *   **Action:** Visually inspect the deployed portfolio or use browser developer tools (e.g., Lighthouse in Chrome) to check for sufficient color contrast, especially for text against backgrounds.

## ðŸ’¡ Next Steps:

Please work on the "High-Priority Tasks" first, especially replacing the placeholder images. Once you have done that, or if you have specific design ideas for the "Enhancements & Best Practices", let me know how you'd like to proceed.
